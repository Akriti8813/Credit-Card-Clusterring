# Credit-Card-Clusterring
Credit Card Clustering
This project aims to cluster credit card transactions into meaningful groups based on their spending patterns. The project uses a dataset of credit card transactions, including the transaction amount and category, to perform clustering analysis.

Methods
The following methods were used in this project:

Data preprocessing: The dataset was cleaned, transformed, and normalized to prepare it for clustering analysis.
Feature engineering: New features were created from existing features to improve the clustering performance.
Clustering algorithm selection: Several clustering algorithms were evaluated, including K-means, DBSCAN, and hierarchical clustering.
Cluster evaluation: The clustering performance was evaluated using metrics such as silhouette score and elbow method.
Visualization: The clusters were visualized using dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and t-SNE.
Results
The final clustering model achieved a silhouette score of 0.6, indicating that the clusters are well-separated and cohesive. The visualization of the clusters revealed distinct spending patterns, such as high-value transactions, frequent small transactions, and occasional large transactions.
